## Description

* A user/employee directory that allows the user to view an entire list of employees and provides quick access to their information.
  In addition, the user is able to view the employee directory in alphabetical order (A-Z and Z-A) by clicking on the 'Name' header
  in the list. Also, the user can filter by name in the search bar, which returns the closest or exact result according to the input.

* The user/employee directory is done mainly through Javascript code and React in Visual Studio Code. There are many Javascript 
  index.js files that are separated in different folders (components/containers), and they overall contain variables (const/let), 
  async & await functions, try/catch blocks, arrays/objects, and import/exports. There are style.css files for each component/container,
  which overall provides the current look of the application. In addition, npm installation was used in order to 
  install axios for the API calls from randomuser.me, and ESLint as a dev dependency to encourage good code syntax/standards. The 
  application was fully deployed through Netlify after running **npm run build** and utilizing Netlify's CLI.

## Technologies

    * Visual Studio Code
    * React
    * Javascript, CSS
    * npm - axios
    * npm (Dev) - ESLint 
    * GitHub
    * Netlify

## Challenges

* Overall, this homework was a bit difficult to understand and implement its required features at first, and this is mainly because 
  of final project week and time constraints, so it was best to get this out of the way by comparing with the given solution,
  and getting the best information out of it. 

* It was a little difficult to understand the solution at first because there were no folders for each component, so it was weird to
  follow the work-flow. After I sorted the files in components/containers with folders for each JavaScript file, I was able to quickly
  understand the logic and piece together the functions, which built the actual employee directory list. 
  
* I learned a lot from this homework, especially being able to understand the logic behind some of the functions. I also learned how
  to deploy my React app in Netlify, which is always cool to know!
